	gastronomy, with allowance for further expansion into other aspects
	of the world of travel. Based on an analysis of currently-available
	data, we develop hotel ontology. Furthermore, we explicitly define
	an ontology for the Chefmoz project data, which has no official
	schema. Finally, we sketch a way to combine these two ontologies
	for use in an integrated travel framework.},
