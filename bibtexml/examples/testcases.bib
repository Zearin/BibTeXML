                 Explanations centers on dynamic data--information that
                 changes over time. The book ranges through a variety of
                 topics, including the explosion of the space shuttle
                 Challenger, magic tricks, a cholera epidemic in
                 19th-century London, and the principle of using ``the
                 smallest effective difference'' to display distinctions
                 in data. The book provides pictures of verbs, cause and
                 effect, and other dynamic patterns of information
                 display, exploring how visual evidence influences
                 computer interfaces, design strategies, and how
                 information is transferred and represented.",
