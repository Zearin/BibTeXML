# Qualified Names
# -
# - This module is contained in two parts, labeled Section 'A' and 'B':
# -
# -   Section A declares parameter entities to support namespace-
# -   qualified names, namespace declarations, and name prefixing.
# -
# -   Section B declares parameter entities used to provide
# -   namespace-qualified names for all element types.

# - This module is derived from the XHTML Qualified Names Template module.

# .....................................................................
# Fields from the standard bibliography styles

# - Below is a description of all fields recognized by the standard
# - bibliography styles.  An entry can also contain other fields, which
# - are ignored by those styles.
# - 
# - [address] Usually the address of the publisher or other type of
# - institution  For major publishing houses, van~Leunen recommends
# - omitting the information entirely.  For small publishers, on the other
# - hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete address.
# - 
# - [annote] An annotation  It is not used by the standard bibliography
# - styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
# - bibliography.
# - 
# - [author] The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
# - LaTeX book.
# - 
# - [booktitle] Title of a book, part of which is being cited.  See the
# - LaTeX book for how to type titles.  For book entries, use the title
# - field instead.
# - 
# - [chapter] A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
# - 
# - [crossref] The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
# - 
# - [edition] The edition of a book-for example, ``Second''.  This
# - should be an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as
# - shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
# - 
# - [editor] Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book.
# - If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the
# - editor of the book or collection in which the reference appears.
# - 
# - [howpublished] How something strange has been published.  The first
# - word should be capitalized.
# - 
# - [institution] The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
# - 
# - [journal] A journal name.  Abbreviations are provided for many
# - journals; see the Local Guide.
# - 
# - [key] Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
# - when the ``author'' information (described in Section [ref: ] is
# - missing. This field should not be confused with the key that appears
# - in the \cite command and at the beginning of the database entry.
# - 
# - [month] The month in which the work was published or, for an
# - unpublished work, in which it was written  You should use the
# - standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of
# - the LaTeX book.
# - 
# - [note] Any additional information that can help the reader.  The first
# - word should be capitalized.
# - 
# - [number] The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
# - work in a series.  An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
# - identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
# - technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
# - given numbers in a named series.
# - 
# - [organization] The organization that sponsors a conference or that
# - publishes a manual.
# - 
# - [pages] One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42-111
# - or 7,41,73-97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages
# - following that don't form a simple range).  To make it easier to
# - maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a
# - single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TeX to denote
# - number ranges (as in 7-33).
# - 
# - [publisher] The publisher's name.
# - 
# - [school] The name of the school where a thesis was written
# - 
# - [series] The name of a series or set of books.  When citing an entire
# - book, the the title field gives its title and an optional series field
# - gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is
# - published.
# - 
# - [title] The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.
# - 
# - [type] The type of a technical report-for example, ``Research Note''.
# - 
# - [volume] The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
# - 
# - [year] The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year
# - it was written.  Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
# - 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four
# - nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `(about 1984)'.
